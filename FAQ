 * Can you sum up this extension in a few sentences?

 This is a kernel extension for Linux(tm) which implements something close
 to the System Integrity Protection feature introduced in Apple's OS X El 
 Capitan. It helps to further harden the system by prohibiting all users
 from writing to files in certain locations that are critical to the system.
 Essentially, this acts as an additional safeguard for systems that *must*
 remain secure.
 
 The key issue nowadays is that many commonly-used programs for Linux,
 especially those used on a server, contain security holes that can give a
 hacker access to a root shell, giving them uncontested control over your
 system. With Filesystem Hierarchy Protection, it will be harder for hackers
 who gain access to your system to e.g. corrupt your operating system with
 malware because most directories where programs can be installed are protected
 by this extension, so nobody (not even root) can write to them.
 
 * But doesn't this mean that the user can't install his own software?

 Not necessarily. If the system administrator decides to allow it, custom
 software can be installed to /usr/local or to a local home directory. Ideally,
 this extension works best with a static software configuration, as any more
 software installed increases the opportunity for vulnerabilities.
 
 * But then how will the user/administrator apply software updates, etc.?
 
 Since more often than not the system administrator has physical access to the
 hardware, he can boot into an external medium, go into a chroot, and apply
 software updates from there. Since Filesystem Hierarchy Protection won't be
 running on this external medium, he will be able to edit files as he could
 otherwise, and as soon as he reboots, Filesystem Hierarchy Protection will
 kick in.
