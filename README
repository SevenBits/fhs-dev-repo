Filesystem Hierarchy Protection (FHP) Linux Kernel Module

===============================================================================

About this module

Filesystem Hierarchy Protection (FHP) is a work-in-progress kernel module for
the Linux(TM) operating system which is intended to provide a similar set of
features to System Integrity Protection, a kernel feature implemented in Apple's
OS X El Capitan to help secure the system by disallowing certain operations from
being performed by the root user.

Filesystem Hierarchy Protection works by denying write and append operations to
files in certain locations deemed vital to system operation, including:

	/usr/bin/
	/bin
	/boot
	/sbin

The intent of this module is to provide a hardened security layer for certain
kinds of Linux systems whose configuration is expected to remain relatively
constant. As of now, the above directories are protected by default when the
module is enabled; later, a user-space tool will be added allowing a qualified
user to add and remove directories from kernel protection.

===============================================================================

WARNING! Use at your own risk!

As this software is pretty much not even alpha quality yet, the standard
disclaimers apply, namely, that I cannot certify that this code will not damage
your system or impair its operation in some other way. I take no responsibility
for this software and provide no warranty of any kind.

===============================================================================

Supported Kernels

This has been tested on the following systems (all 64bit):

 - Linux Mint 17.2 (3.13.0-49-generic)

This module *should* work on most Linux kernels that are relatively recent, but
it has has only been verified on the above systems. If you get a compile error 
or a kernel panic/crash, please contact this module's author.

===============================================================================

Features (implemented and planned)

* Deny root the ability to write to protected system directories
* Configurable using a user-space command line tool

Installation

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

FAQ

License

See the GPL file for license information (spoiler: it's GPL v2).

Compatibility Issues

Test this module before deploying to a critical system, especially if you're
not using a kernel in the above "Supported Kernels" list and especially since
this module is nowhere near complete. I strongly advise testing this on a
separate system or virtual machine in the event of kernel panics. You have
been warned!

===============================================================================

Current State

This code was started as a "proof of concept" and the intention is to turn it
into a valuable security tool at some point in the (admittedly very distant)
future.

===============================================================================

BUGS

There are currently no *known* bugs -- this should not be mistaken, however,
for an assertion that there aren't any bugs. If you discover a bug, please
report it to the author.

If your system crashes as a result of FHP, consider setting the following:

sudo sysctl kernel.panic_on_oops=0

This will give you a chance to capture the kernel errors in your system logs.
