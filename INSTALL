Eventually, this will ship in Debian and Red Hat packages. For now though,
you need to build and install from source. You will need to be somewhat
competent in Linux to be able to reasonably do this.

To build the module from source, run "make". Output will look like:

	$ make
		cd src && make
		make[1]: Entering directory `/home/ryan/Code/mod-test/src'
		make -C /lib/modules/3.13.0-49-generic/build M=/home/ryan/Code/mod-test/src modules
		make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.13.0-49-generic'
		  CC [M]  /home/ryan/Code/mod-test/src/main.o
		  Building modules, stage 2.
		  MODPOST 1 modules
		  CC      /home/ryan/Code/mod-test/src/main.mod.o
		  LD [M]  /home/ryan/Code/mod-test/src/main.ko
		make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.13.0-49-generic'
		make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/ryan/Code/mod-test/src'

Then, simply insert the module:

	$ sudo insmod main.ko

Note that, since this extension is currently a proof-and-concept, there is
no installation option (since you shouldn't be using it on a real system
anyway). Because of this, you must manually load and unload the kernel
module yourself. If you don't know how to do this, then this project is
probably not right for you at this stage. Sorry.
